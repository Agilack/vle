VLE 1.1.0-dev
=============

We merge all shared libraries of vle (libvleutils, libvlevpz,
libvledevs etc.) into a uniq shared library libvle.so.

We remove the Eov program and the libvleeov shared library. Now,
graphical output are available into the GVLE application.

- libvleutils:

  - Add a new RemoteMananger class to access remote repositories. The
    command line interface is inspirited from the apt-get debian's
    command:

  $ vle --remote update
  $ vle --remote install glue
  $ vle --remote search '*gl*'
  $ vle --remote show glue

  - Change the packages directory name. To allow the use of VLE 1.0
    and 1.1 on the same ``$VLE_HOME`` directory, we need to clearly
    split the packages from the two versions. We add in the VLE's
    version.hpp file, a macro ``VLE_ABI_VERSION`` equal to
    ``VLE_VERSION_MAJOR.VLE_VERSION_MINOR``. We use this macro to
    define the name of the pkgs directory. For example, in VLE 1.1,
    the package directory is defined as ``vle/pkgs-1.1`` and in VLE
    1.2, the package directory is defined as ``vle/pkgs-1.2``. The
    current stable version of VLE is not change and use packages in
    ``vle/pkgs`` directory.

- libvlevpz:

  - Remove any reference to distant and local dynamics plugins.

- libvlegeometry: removed

- libvleeov: removed
