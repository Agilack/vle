VLE 0.8.0
=========

* project:
  * Add the Gettext functionality.

* vle:
  * Update the path management in VLE:
    - Remove all environment variables: VLE_SIMULATOR_PATH, VLE_OOV_PATH,
      VLE_MODEL_PATH. Replace these variables by a new one: VLE_HOME. This
      variable defines the home of models, simulators, packages and other
      plug-ins of VLE. If this variable is not defined, the $HOME/.vle or
      %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%/vle is used.
    - Remove optional path and program option from vle, eov, etc.
  * Change the VPZ format: replace the #PCDATA by vle::value in the vpz
    format and build a new DTD (vle-0.8.0.dtd).
  * Remove Assert and Throw macros from the API to remove conflict with the C
    API of scripting language like Python.

* gvle:
  * Big update, see changelog for the details.

* oov:
  * SimpleFile, the super class of txt, rdata, csv plug-ins, can now use the
    standard output and error and can be configured to select localized value.



VLE 0.7.0
=========

* vle:
  * Remove the boost shared pointer around value::Value. This change break API
    for the observation function in the devs::Dynamics class.
  * Optimise the allocation / deallocation of the objects from class
    vle::value::Value using the boost pool memory allocation. This change
    improve simulation by 10 or 20%.
  * Add serialization function in class vle::value::Value. This change
    allow the building of binary stream between component Eov - Vle and for the
    next DEVS kernel with parallelization base on thread and MPI.
  * Change the pseudo random generator Glib::Rand to the boost::mersenne19937.
  * Update differential equation order 1
  * Update difference equation: new clearly syntax and improve speed for a
    common API.
  * Clean the API of the devs::Executive class. Break completely API
    for models based on this class (translators and classical models).

* eov:
  * Remove the XML stream by the new binary stream provides by the value::Value
    library.
  * Change behaviours of the Eov and Oov with graphics outputs plug-ins:
    - Eov and Oov can now produces png files.
    - Eov provides a newly thread system that correct bugs on Win32 port.
  * Add a new visualization graph plug-in.

* win32 :
  * Use the newly Boost 1.38 libraries.
  * Use the Gtkmm 2.14 libraries.
  * Build chm files instead of classical doxygen html files.



VLE 0.6.2
=========

* vle:
  * Bug fix.



VLE 0.6.1
=========

* vle:
  * Big fix in PetriNet.
  * Bug fix.

* gvle:
  * Show the filename into windows title.
  * Bug fix.



VLE 0.6.0
=========

* project:
  * Merge repository of vle, gvle, eov and examples.
  * Use CPack to build Debian, RPM and Win32 packages.
  * Add soversion to the dynamic libraries.

* vle:
  * Add a command line option -i or --infos to show the set of paths used by
    the project.
  * Add DifferenceEquation DEVS extension.
  * Update PetriNet DEVS extension.
  * Update DifferencialEquation DEVS extension.
  * Add DESS extension with Runge Kutta (order 4) and Euler.

* gvle:
  * Improve the usability of the GUI.

* rvle:
  * Add two function to manage the seed of the simulation.

* eov:
  * Remove the daemon mode.



VLE 0.5.2
=========

* vle:
  * Add environment variable to manage the paths of plug-ins:
    VLE_SIMULATOR_PATH, VLE_OOV_PATH, VLE_MODEL_PATH.
  * Bug fix.



VLE 0.5.1
=========

* vle:
  * Add method for the GVLE application.
  * Bug fix.

* gvle:
  * First release.
  * Bug fix.



VLE 0.5.0
=========

* project:
  * Switch the VLE application to GPL v3.0.

* vle:
  * Add an API to get results of simulations by using a special plug-in
    called 'storage'. This function allows a complete use of scripting language
    like R, Python.
  * Update the API of the translator library.
  * Add a finish view to get results only at the end of a simulation.
  * Add multiples conditions for atomic model.
  * Update the API of the devs::Dynamic class:
     - change processInitEvent to constructor.
     - change processExternalEvent to externalTransition which receives the
       lists of external events.
     - change getOutputFunction to output.
     - remove the parseXML function. Use the InitEventList now.
     - simplify confluentTransitions which merge with externalTransition and a
       confluentTransition.
  * Add a new value XML.
  * Update algorithms in libgraph to improve speed of events routing.
  * Change values from objects to the boost shared pointer.
  * Clean source code: delete sModel and sCoupledModel and rename sAtomicModel
    to simulator, simulator to coordinator and coordinator to root-coordinator.
  * Add the possibility to develop multiples dynamics into the same dynamic
    library (.so, .dll, .dylib) by using a new macro DECLARE_NAMED_DYNAMICS.
  * Change the VPZ format and add a dtd.
  * Change the XML format between eov / vle.

* oov:
  * Add a new library 'liboov'.
  * Add a new plug-in 'storage' to store result in memory.
  * Add an API to develop Cairo oov plug-ins.

* rvle:
  * Add R package.
