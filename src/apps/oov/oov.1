.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This manual page documents briefly the \fBOOV\fR command. 
.PP
\fBOOV\fR is a part of a multi-modelling and simulation framework call
\fBVLE\fR. It addresses the reliability issue using recent developments in the
theory of Modelling and Simulation proposed by Zeigler and open sources
software. \fBVLE\fR is composed of five applications: \fIVLE\fR the simulator,
\fIGVLE\fR the modelling tool, \fIAVLE\fR the analysis tools post-simulation
and \fIEOV\fR a real time application to make observation and \fIOOV\fR the output
stream manager.
.PP 
\fBOOV\fR is a program that use output from \fBVLE\fR simulator to build text,
xml, graphics of datas generated by \fBVLE\fR. \fBOOV\fR can listen a TCP/IP
port and can run in a daemon mode.

.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (`\-'). A summary of options is included below. 

.IP "\fB-?\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP" 10 
Show summary of options. 

.IP "\fB-i\fP, \fB\-\-info\fP" 10 
Show somes informations for vle framework. 

.IP "\fB\-\-version\fP" 10 
Show version of program. 

.IP "\fB-v\fI int\fR\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fI int \fR\fP"
Set the verbosity of application. Default is \fI0\fR, no trace and no long
exception. \fI1\fR for small simulation trace and long exception. \fI2\fR for
long simulation trace. 3 for all simulation trace. 

.IP "\fB-d\fP, \fB\-\-daemon\fP
Run the vle program in daemon mode. This option is only available for the
\fBManager\fP application. This mode just \fBfork\fP the program to attach ppid
to init process. 

.IP "\fB-p\fI int\fR\fP, \fB\-\-port\fI int \fR\fP
Define the listening port for vle application. Default is 8888. This option is
only available for the mode \fBManager\fP and \fBSimulator\fP.
